# Editor Scripting Example

In this tutorial repository and [associated video](https://youtu.be/0q114vTBjB4) you will learn how to extend an existing Inspector in the Unity Editor and draw debug information in the Scene View.

This primarily is using the [Handles API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Handles.html) for Scene View drawing by implementing a [Custom Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/editor-CustomEditors.html) for a class. The "Editor Scripting" comes in by doing similar things to what you would do in your game, in the "Editor" script, such as placing objects, drawing some things, or text.
